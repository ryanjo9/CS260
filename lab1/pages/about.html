    <h1>A B O U T</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <P>My name is Ryan O'Laughlin (pronounced O-Lock-lin)</p>
    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>I am a sophomore in the computer science program at BYU in Provo, UT</p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>My first job was delivering pizza when I was 16. After too much free pizza I got a job changing oil and doing other simple stuff on cars. I took a break from work to serve a mission for my church and then worked in the shop at a Ford dealership.
      I moved into the computer world doing IT for BYU Police and just started my first job as a software developer</p>
    <h2>Service</h2>
    <p>I served a two year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Seattle, WA. While there I spent a lot of time serving the homeless population there. After I started college, I coached a soccer team of 5th and 6th graders and
      am now working with some friends to start a program to teach kids how to code.</p>
